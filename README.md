Panomity DarkWeb Press Foundation for DarkWeb Connectivity.

## Description

Looking for a robust and user-friendly data security plugin for your WordPress site? Look no further than Panomity DarkWeb Press! With this incredible plugin, you can seamlessly integrate your WordPress setup with the Panomity DarkWeb API to enhance the security of your data.

The plugin boasts a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy authentication of your Panomity account. Once authenticated, you can leverage three powerful shortcodes to allow your website visitors to verify whether their password, email account, or domain name has been compromised and traded on the dark web. By using Panomity DarkWeb Press, you can increase security awareness for your users, keeping them safe from potential security threats. Moreover, you'll have access to a range of cached comprehensive statistics that reveal the number of dark web queries performed on your site.

But wait, there's more! This exceptional plugin includes a bulk check page that lets you notify registered users of your WordPress site if their email accounts have been compromised in Dark Web breaches. Furthermore, with additional Gutenberg blocks available for each check (coming soon!), you'll have everything you need to enhance security awareness.

As a WordPress webmaster, you can earn referral commissions by providing your users with more detailed dark web reports through Panomity's premium services. With our powerful referral program, you can earn money while providing your users with the advanced security features they need to keep their information secure. So why wait? Install Panomity DarkWeb Press today and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you help to make the web a safer place, while also earning referral commissions!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I am only seeing that a password/domain/email has been leaked XY times. How can I find out where it has been leaked?
We decided to start with the most simple password/domain/email check and provide only a simple answer (leaked or not leaked) for a start. Your users will be able to purchase a more in-depth report and as our affiliate you can earn commissions for referrals.

### How do you verify that only authorized domain administrators can see if a domain has been leaked?
Great question. Once you query a domain, such as example.com, we will send our findings to the **hostmaster** email address associated with the domain (i.e. *hostmaster@example.com*). This ensures that only authorized domain administrators can view the results.

### Can you send the emails for the domain findings to another email?
For ease of use, our plugin sends domain findings to the email address *hostmaster@yourdomain.com*. Unfortunately, we cannot change this through our plugin. However, if you order our [Dark Web Scan service](https://support.panomity.com/cart/dark-web-scans/), we can offer different manual methods of authorization.

### What happens when I search if an email address has been traded on the dark web?
Thank you for your question. To protect your privacy, we will not display our findings on the WordPress website and they will not be revealed to the WordPress webmaster. Instead, we will send an email with a link where only the account holder can review our findings.

### Can I make money by referring users to you?
Yes, we offer an [affiliate program](https://support.panomity.com/affiliates/).

### I would love to resell your services.
Thank you for your interest in our services. Please contact us via our [support ticket system](https://support.panomity.com/tickets/new/) and let us know your plan. We look forward to working with you.

### I would like to be notified when my data appears on the Dark Web.
We offer two Daily Dark Web Scan services for personal and business use that sound like what you're looking for. Please check out the following links for more information:
- [Daily Personal Scans](https://support.panomity.com/cart/dark-web-scans/?id=568)
- [Daily Business Scans](https://support.panomity.com/cart/dark-web-scans/?id=570)

### Can I submit more than one email address to be checked?
Yes, you can bulk check the registered users of your WordPress site after gaining their authorization.
Further on, our API allows you to batch query up to [100 email accounts](https://support.panomity.com/userapi#batch-query-up-to-100-user-submitted-accounts-against-dark-web-leak-db-127.) at once. You can find more information about our API [here](https://support.panomity.com/userapi). If you wish to allow for a bulk check on your WordPress frontend site and there is enough demand for it, we are open to making this feature available to WordPress users. Please contact us via our [support ticket system](https://support.panomity.com/tickets/new/) to let us know.

### I see some additional functions in your API that are not available in Panomity DarkWeb Press. Can you add them?
Thank you for your feedback. We are always looking to improve our services and provide the best experience for our users. If there is enough demand for it, we are open to making additional API functions available to WordPress users or creating additional API endpoints. Please contact us via our [support ticket system](https://support.panomity.com/tickets/new/) to let us know.

### I belong to a government organization and we would like to use your API.
Our monitored API is open to governmental organizations in the EU and any third party country with a Corruption Perceptions Index score of 80 or higher. 

### How much data do you cover?
By the end of 2022 the darkweb database covered over 10 billion leaked credentials. The number of credentials is growing exponentially.

### I am a developer and would like to use your API.
We are excited to hear that you are interested in using our API. Please contact us via our [support ticket system](https://support.panomity.com/tickets/new/) and let us know how you plan on using it. We look forward to working with you.
